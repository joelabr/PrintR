# PrintR
This is a small Windows utility for sending RAW print jobs to an installed printer.

PrintR was created because I lacked a way of sending raw ZPL labels to a label
printer from the command line. It was possible through different kinds of "hacks"
which I did not want to resolve to, so PrintR was created to fulfill this need.

## Usage
    .\PrintR.exe PRINTER [FILES]
